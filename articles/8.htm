      <p>Mr. John H. Dean Secretary, Y. M. C. A., assisted by Chaplain Springer, is holding a series of interesting meetings in the Post Chapel. The meetings have been held each night throughout the week and have been largely attended by the enlisted men and many natives. Mr. Dean is an excellent talker and has a faculty of drawing and retaining the close attention of his audience. Two boys have been favorably impressed with his short talks and they believe another week of meetings would be good for all.</p>
