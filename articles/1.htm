      <h1>THE NEW ARMY BILL</h1>
      <hr width="50px">
      <p class="center"><strong>Official Information has been Received Stating that the Bill has been Favorably Accepted by Both Houses—No Provisions made for Enlisted Men.</strong></p>
      <hr width="50px">
      <p>The Army Bill has been favorably accepted by both Houses and it is stated on good authority that the bill, with very few amendments and one or two minor sections added, will pass both branches and become a law as soon as put up for ballot. The only material change in the bill the reduction of the number and allowance of staff officers.</p>
      <p>The status of the hill effects the enlisted men very little, and the only change concerning them is the article providing for two color sergeants in each regiment of infantry, allowing them the pay and allowances of a battalion sergeant-major. The clothing, transportation and mess allowance of enlisted men remain about the same. The pay remains as has been heretofore, and no inducements, in the way of transportation or increased pay, is offered to those re-enlisting.</p>
      <p>One of the amendments provides for the detail of 100 retired commissioned and 300 non-commissioned officers as military instructors in the public schools of such cities as may adopt a system of military instruction; and another provides for the increase of the standing ring, to a permanent strength of 50,000 men and temporary increase of 100,000 men. The regimental organization of the artillery arm, is abolished, and hereafter this branch of the service will be known as the Artillery Corps, consisting of two branches, coast and field artillery Burps. The bill provides the companies of cavalry and infantry shall be 65 enlisted men strong and in foreign service, cavalry troops will be 100 strong and infantry companies, 148 strong, with the privilege of recruiting four per cent in excess of that number during active field service.</p>
