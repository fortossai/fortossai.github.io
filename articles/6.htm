        <p>The U. S. A. T. Port Albert arrived from Manila Wednesday, with a consignment of horses, mules, and forage, to the Q. M.

A large number of teamsters and packers also arrived on the same vessel.</p>
        <hr width="50px">
        <p>Several of the officers stationed here, went to San Vincente, Thursday, on the "Albert" to witness the unloading of the cargo of homes and mules, as this is a very interesting feat, as the work must be done with cascoes and the animals do not always take kindly to such fragile boats, thereby causing much amusement for the onlooker and much excitement for the native boatmen.</p>
