      <p>Lieut. C. W. Weeks returned Saturday from his tour around the river, inspecting schools, and left Wednesday, accompanied by a detachment of men from "A" Company left behind for that purpose, on a tour of inspection in the remainder of the District. It is unlikely that the Lieut. will return to Aparri soon as he expects to join his company at Echague, when his tour of inspection is completed and the various schools in the District have been supplied with their quota of school materall. Lieut Weeks is a most genial and accomplished officer and his many friends in Aparri wish him health, happiness, and success abundant in all his future undertakings and duties.</p>
