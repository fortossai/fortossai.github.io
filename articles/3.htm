      <hr width="50px">
      <p>Postmaster Mullery requests that, for the benefit of the enlisted men in this District, it be stated that the Postal and Military Laws prohibit the delivery of firearms to enlisted men and that those contemplating sending home for such articles should abandon the idea as they cannot be sent through the mail to them. He has several revolvers to the Post Office at the present time, mailed by parties to the States to enlisted men stationed there, and they will be a dead loss to them as they can neither be delivered to the addresses or returned to the sender.</p>
