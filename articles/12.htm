      <hr width="50px">
      <p>Through our special hospital correspondent we have received a humoristic bill of fare of the mess of the Chief Surgeon's office and Medical Supply Depot, consisting of the following members: Harry T. Temple, Anton F. Miller, Robert Anderson and Romain Fair. No wonder that some of them are getting so stout—like democratic aldermen in the States:</p>
      <h3>BILL OF FARE<br>NEW YEAR'S DAY</h3>
      <h3>RELISHES</h3>
      <p class="center">Olives, Radishes, Chutney, Celery, etc.<br>(on account of rainy season could not be got.)</p>
    <h3>SOUPS</h3>
    <p class="center">Mock Turtle, Julienne, Cream Tomatoes<br>(this course was left out on account of a wrong reckoning in the Commissary Department.)</p>
