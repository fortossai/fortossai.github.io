      <hr width="50px">
      <p>Saturday, December 1st, a detachment from Company F, 16th Infantry, and Company K, and Band, 49th Vols., consisting of twenty-one men, under command of Capt. Vaiden, 49th Vols., left Tuguegarao on a scouting expedition toward Cabagan Nuevo, stopping at the latter place for the night, having thoroughly scoured the country between that point and Tuguegarao. At an early hour the following morning, in compliance with verbal orders from Major Robert Gage, 49th Vols., the command proceeded on a tour through the Cabagan river swamps, taking with them a sergeant of Company E, 16th. Infantry, and a native prisoner as a guide.</p>
      <p>The command thoroughly scouted the country in their immediate vicinity, closely following dim and almost impassable trails, often wading through mud and water neck deep, but nothing of importance took place until about dark, when a steep embankment near the pueblo of Masipi was reached, where, from the evidence at hand, Capt. Vaiden came to the conclusion that he was nearing an insurgent stronghold. The command was at once divided and preparations made to surround the place. After the surrounding party bad departed an attempt was made to ascend the embankment which was very steep and slippery, making it a difficult task, the men having to assist one another up.</p>
      <p>Capt. Vaiden was the first up the bank but he had no more than mounted the top when he was halted by a sentry who opened fire which the Captain returned alone until his men had made the ascent when a general fire was opened by the Americans: which the "gugus" returned, seriously wounding the native guide. A steady fire was kept up until the surrounding party, which had been delayed by the deep mud and steep slippery embankment along their path, opened fire on the opposite side when the insurgents scattered in every direction. It was impossible for the detachment to follow the enemy as their guide was unable to travel and It was necessary that he should receive medical attention as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>A careful search was made in the vicinity of the fight which resulted in the location of 1 Krag, 1 Remington and 2 Mauser rifles; 1 B. L. Remington shotgun, 2 U. S. cartridge belts, 4 native cartridge boxes filled with ammunition, 1 Krag bayonet and scabbard, 11 bolos, 7 spears, 1,000 rounds of Remington ammunition, 1 brass trumpet, 5 native ponies, $48.50 in Mexican silver, two insurgent muster rolls and a package of very important papers, all of which were taken possession of. The command then made. its way to Masipi where the guide was left in the care of friends until the detachment returned to Cabagan Nuevo, when a surgeon visited him. The place where the fight occurred must have been regular insurgent camp for the place was well located and intrenched. A remarkable protection surrounded the camp, consisting of a series of ditches about four feet wide and four feet deep, in the bottom of which, sharp pointed strips of bamboo had been driven about two inches apart, and in a large tree near the place a "crows nest" had been built. which a sentry occupied. The unfortunate guide. has since died.</p>
