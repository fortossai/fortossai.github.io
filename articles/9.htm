      <hr width="50px">
      <p>News has been received here that a refrigerating transport has left Manila with a cargo of fresh beef which is to be distributed to the troops stationed at the several ports between here and Manila. It is not known just when the vessel will arrive here, as many stops will have to be made before this port is reached, but all the boys are anxiously awaiting her arrival, as frozen meat will be something on the order of a luxury just now as it has been sometime since fresh meat of any description could be procured.</p>
