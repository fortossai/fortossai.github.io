      <hr width="50px">
      <p>New orders have been issued changing the time many of the "calls" in this post. Guard mount now takes place at 9:00 a. m., instead of at 4:30 p. m. as was the custom under the old order. Drill call feature of the day now, the troops drilling one hour daily, except Saturday and Sunday. Tuesdays and Thursdays are dress parade days, and Wednesdays drill hour will be consumed in lectures on "first aid to wounded."</p>
