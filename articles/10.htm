      <p>The entire second story of the building on Calle Legaspi has been procured by the Chaplain and it is now being remodeled and refurnished for use as a chapel. The new arrangement will give seperate apartments for the chapel and reading room, as well as a seperate room for the Y. M. C. A. department. where games, etc., are to be kept. The change will be beneficial to all, for formerly everything pertaining to this work was crowded into one room.</p>
