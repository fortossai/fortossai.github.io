      <p class="center"><strong>CHINESE LAUNDRY BURNED</strong></p>
      <hr width="50px">
      <p>Tuesday morning, about 2 o'clock, the soldiers occupying the quarters near the parade grounds, as well as all other residing in that vicinity, were rudely awakened from their peaceful slumbers by the report of several shots and the cry of Fire! Fire! The cause of the excitement was a blaze in the large nipa structure occupied by John Ah Gee & Co., as a laundry, which was totally destroyed, despite the herculean efforts of the troops to subdue the flames.</p>
      <p>The fire was first discovered by the sentry on number one post, who immediately gave the alarm. The call was at once sounded and the troops occupying the quarters near the scene of the conflagration responded in a remarkably short time, but, prompt as they were, they were powerless to save the burning building and only by heroic efforts did they save the buildings in the immediate vicinity.</p>
      <p>A high wind was blowing at the time, and on several occasions fire broke out on the roofs of several of the buildings near the fire. At one time, breaking out on the roof of the building used as quarters for the officers, more than 200 yards from the burning "shack." The roof of the guard house and "I" Company's quarters also caught fire, and only through hard work and the fact that fire buckets had been previously provided and placed in convenient places in the quarters were those buildings saved from destruction. Several of the officers and men stationed here lost heavily in clothing by the fire as the laundry was patronized extensively by the soldiers and it is said that the wardrobes of the lady nurses was depleted considerably by the flames.</p>
      <p>The losses are very heavy, no doubt, owing to the fact that Tuesday is a laundry's "busy day." It is said that a large amount of the clothing could have been saved had the Chinamen sleeping in the building been less excited, but from all accounts, it seems that after saving their own individual property, they ran aimlessly about, like so many scared rabbits, until help arrived, which was too late to save anything as it took but a few minutes for the fire to envelope the light bamboo poles and nipa leaves, which burned like powder.</p>
